# Face Prediction Using Image Classification

**Objective:** <br/>
Built an image classification model using OpenCV to recognize and classify sports celebrities from images.  <br/>
The project aimed to train a system to automatically identify celebrities based on facial features using real-world image data. <br/> <br/>

**Description: **<br/><br/>

**Original Image:**<br/>

**matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()** function used to display images in a plot. <br/>
It allows you to visualize images as 2D data. <br/>
This function is widely used for displaying images, matrices, or heatmaps where each value in the array corresponds to a color. <br/>

**cv2.rectangle()** method is used to draw a rectangle on any image. <br/>
Syntax: cv2.rectangle(image, start_point, end_point, color, thickness) <br/>

**To Draw two eyes:**  <br/>
Iterates over detected faces and draws a blue rectangle (255, 0, 0) around each face.  <br/>
Extracts Region of Interest (ROI) for the face. <br/>

**2D Discrete Wavelet Transform:** <br/>
Wavelet Transform decomposes an image into components at multiple resolutions using small wave-like functions.  <br/>
It captures both frequency and location information, making it ideal for analyzing non-stationary signals and extracting meaningful patterns. <br/>
